# # Intro

![cover](/projects/quiz-quizz/cover.jpg)

First of all this is a toy project, to know about transitions between pages and also animating objects using greensock animation platform (GSAP). Previously, I also had experience animating objects using Framer Motion, but Greensock was different. The first impression I felt when using this library was that it was amazing, apart from how easy it is to animate everything that JavaScript can touch, this library is available for Vue, React or vanilla Javascript and It's really very well documented, you will feel for yourself the difference in animating something using these two libraries.
